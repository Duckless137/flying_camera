# Notes for the Engineers:
If you're on my engineering team: 

This is the code for our Arduino.
Feel free to check the vars.h file,
which contains all the values needed
to know what pins and such each
device is on. Also, if you see any
crude code comments, remind me to delete
those before turning this in to UT.

# Building:
Umm good luck lmfao

# Contributions:
If you're on my engineering team,
have at it, just stick to `vars.h`.
Otherwise, fuck off.
